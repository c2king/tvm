            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Time Value of Money (TVM) is a fundamental concept in finance that recognizes that money available now is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This concept is crucial for university business students to understand because it forms the basis for many financial decisions, including investment analysis, capital budgeting, and loan calculations.</p>
            <p>Key TVM concepts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Present Value (PV)</li>
                <li>Future Value (FV)</li>
                <li>Compound Interest</li>
                <li>Annuities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding TVM allows students to make informed financial decisions and evaluate investment opportunities effectively.</p>
